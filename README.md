# FrogCrew-Event-Scheduler

The Frog Crew Scheduling System aims to streamline and automate the scheduling process for TCU Sports Broadcasting. By eliminating the manual handling of crew availability and reducing errors caused by scattered communication, this system will simplify operations for administrators and crew members alike. The system will allow for easy scheduling, crew list generation, and reporting, ensuring smooth operation for all athletic events covered by TCU Sports Broadcasting.

Includes both front-end development with Vue.js and back-end development with Spring Boot (Java).
